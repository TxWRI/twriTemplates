# Executive Summary {-}

We might include an executive summary or abstract here.

# Headings

Main document text starts here!

## Second Level Heading

### Third Level Heading

First, second, and third level headings are defined by `#`, `##`, and `###` respectively.

# Unumbered heading {-}

Headings are automatically numbered. If you want a section heading to remain unnumbered use ` {-} ` after the heading.



# Tables


Raw data output will not format as a table. Use `knitr::kable()` or the [`kableExtra`](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/) package to format tables. 
This is an example of how we cross-reference that table (Table \@ref(tab:mtcars)).


```{r mtcars}
dat <- mtcars
knitr::kable(head(dat, n = 10),
             caption = "this is the builtin mtcars data.",
             format = "latex",
             booktabs = TRUE)
```



# Figures

We can embed and cross-reference plots (Figure \@ref(fig:pressure)).

```{r pressure, fig.cap="pressure dataset", fig.alt="Alternative text for screen readers"}
plot(pressure)
```




\newpage
\blandscape

# Landscape Section

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='sin function', fig.id='sinus', fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
x <- seq(1,30, by = .1)
plot(x, sin(x), type = "l", main = "", xlab = "", ylab = "", col = "#CC4300")
```

# Math

Wrap variables or math in a single `$` to show math inline. For example, $\varepsilon \sim \mathrm{N}(0,1)$. Standalone equations are wrapped with `$$`.

$$
\left(\prod_{i=1}^{n}y_i\right)^{\frac{1}{n}} = 
\exp\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\log{y_i}\right], 
\quad \textrm{when} \quad y_1, y_2, ..., y_n > 0
$$

If the equations need to be numbered and cross-referenced the format as:

```tex
\begin{equation}
\left(\prod_{i=1}^{n}y_i\right)^{\frac{1}{n}} = 
\exp\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\log{y_i}\right], 
\quad \textrm{when} \quad y_1, y_2, ..., y_n > 0
(\#eq:gmean)
\end{equation}
```

Which renders as (Equation \@ref(eq:gmean)):

\begin{equation}
\left(\prod_{i=1}^{n}y_i\right)^{\frac{1}{n}} = 
\exp\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\log{y_i}\right], 
\quad \textrm{when} \quad y_1, y_2, ..., y_n > 0
(\#eq:gmean)
\end{equation}

# References

In-text references and bibliography generation are handled automatically. It relies on creating a bibtex `.bib` file with your references. Software such as Zotero, Mendely, and even Google Scholar can generate the bibtex entries for you. The entries are stored in the `bibliography.bib` file inside the same directory as this `.Rmd` file. There is an example file in the same directory as this `.Rmd` file that you can update with your bibliographic entries. To make a in-text citation, use the following syntax, `[@helsel_statistical_2002]` to generate the reference at the end of this sentence [@helsel_statistical_2002]. Use a semicolon to include multiple references `[@helsel_statistical_2002; @hirsch2010weighted]` [@helsel_statistical_2002; @hirsch2010weighted]. Or we might use `@helsel_statistical_2002` without brackets to indicate @helsel_statistical_2002 provide a fundamental overview of water quality statistics. The bibliography will populate automatically.

# Styling and fonts

This template uses Minion Pro for body fonts and Open Sans for headings following TWRI brand guidance and AgriLife brand guidance. I can't bundle Minion Pro in this package because of licensing, but you can download and install both fonts from AgriLife (https://agrilife.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AgriFonts.zip). I recommend downloading and installing the fonts before knitting your documents.
