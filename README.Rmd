This package provides:

-   Rmarkdown templates for work and pdf documents that follow recommended brand guidance
-   ggplot themes for common design styles between projects

## Installation

twriTemplates lives on Github, install using the remotes package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("TxWRI/twriTemplates")
```

## Usage

### Prerequisites

The Rmarkdown templates assume the required fonts are installed on your system. The `Minion Pro` and `Open Sans` fonts among others are used by the various templates and themes. We aren't licensed to distribute some of the fonts. Install all the fonts AgriLife provides at the [Marketing and Communications branding website](https://agrilife.tamu.edu/marketing-and-communications/resources/branding-agrilife/).

In order to use the pdf template, please install the tinytex package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
tinytex::is_tinytex()
```

Make sure the last function returns `TRUE`.

### Templates

Create a new Rmarkdown document, select "From Template", and the TWRI PDF template and TWRI doc template will be available in the list.

A new .Rmd file will open with example text and guidance in the document.

### Theme

ggplot themes are provided for print and powerpoint presentation. The main difference is that the fonts on the presentation styled theme are scaled larger to facilitate reading from the back row in an auditorium. There is also a function to add TWRI branding to your plots.

```{r reporttheme, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=4}
library(twriTemplates)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

## report theme
p1 <- Dissolved_Oxygen %>%
  mutate(Station_ID = as.factor(Station_ID)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Station_ID, 
             Min_DO, 
             fill = Station_ID, 
             color = Station_ID)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.9, width = 0.1, height = 0) +
  theme_TWRI_fig() +
  scale_color_discrete_twri(name = "Station ID") +
  scale_fill_discrete_twri(name = "Station ID") +
  labs(x = "Station ID", 
       y = "Dissolved Oxygen, Min [mg/L]", 
       title = "24-hr Minimum Dissolved Oxygen, Tres Palacios River",
       caption = "Source: TCEQ SWQM")
p1
```

```{r prestheme, fig.width=10, fig.height=7.5}
## presentation theme
## suggested export size is 10 inches wide by 7.5 inches tall.
p2 <- Dissolved_Oxygen %>%
  mutate(Station_ID = as.factor(Station_ID)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Min_DO, 
             fill = Station_ID, 
             color = Station_ID)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~Station_ID) +
  theme_TWRI_pres() +
  scale_color_discrete_twri(name = "Station ID") +
  scale_fill_discrete_twri(name = "Station ID") +
  labs(x = "Dissolved Oxygen, Min [mg/L]",
       y = "n measurements",
       title = "24-hr Minimum Dissolved Oxygen, Tres Palacios River",
       caption = "Source: TCEQ SWQM") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
p2
```


```{r logo, fig.width=10, fig.height=7.5}
add_TWRI_logo(p2, scale = 0.2)
```
