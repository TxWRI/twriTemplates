# twriTemplates

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This package provides:

-   Rmarkdown templates for work and pdf documents that follow recommended brand guidance
-   ggplot theme for common design styles between projects (incomplete)

## Installation

twriTemplates lives on Github, install using the remotes package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("TxWRI/twriTemplates")
```

## Usage

### Prerequisites

The Rmarkdown templates assume the required fonts are installed on your system. The `Minion Pro` and `Open Sans` fonts are used by both templates. We aren't licensed to distribute `Minion Pro` so it is not bundled in this template. If you have access to Creative Cloud, both fonts can be installed through the Creative Cloud App. Otherwise, AgriLife provides the fonts through the [Marketing and Communications branding website](https://agrilife.tamu.edu/marketing-and-communications/resources/branding-agrilife/).

In order to use the pdf template, please install the tinytex package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
tinytex::is_tinytex()
```

Make sure the last function returns `TRUE`.

### Templates

Create a new Rmarkdown document, select "From Template", and the TWRI PDF template and TWRI doc template will be available in the list.
